[Try it for yourself on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hboadpjkoaieogjimneceaahlppnipaa/publish-accepted?authuser=0&hl=en-US)

We've all been there. 20 tabs of Rate My Professor, Catalyst, and the UT Course Catalog open and you still don't know what classes to take. 
This extension tries to streamline most of the unnecessary steps and headaches of registering for classes at UT Austin.

- For each class on the UT Course Catalog it provides a "breakdown" popup, with quick and easy links to the RateMyProfessor and eCIS pages of the professor, as well as syllabi from when the professor taught the class in the past. 

- Gets the course description and highlight the important information like prerequisites, restrictions, etc. 

- Shows an aggregate graph of the grade distributions for when the professor taught the class in the past. 

- Gives you the ability to "Save Courses" and view them in the extension popup. This lets you see any schedule conflicts, and makes copy-pasting the unique code much easier when you're actually registering.
